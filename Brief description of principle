 Goals: The circuit display section is divided into north-south and east-west traffic lights. When the north-south road is red, the east-west road
 is green, and the lighting time is 30s. When the north-south road red light ends, the digital countdown starts to display on the digital
 tube 10S. When the red light on the North and South Road is at the last 3s, the green light on the East and West Road will start to flash,
 and will turn to the yellow light;When the 30s time is over, the green light on the east-west road turns to yellow, and the time is 5s. At
 this time, the north-south road is still a red light;After 3.5s, the north-south road is green and the east-west road is red.The above 
 process is continuously repeated afterwards. Improved part: set up east-west and north-south pedestrian buttons. When the pedestrian 
 button is pressed, the red light turns to the green light after 3S, and the yellow light flashes for 3 seconds and turns red.
